## Price Action Candlestick Charting

Candlesticks provide a powerful way to visualize price movements. They
display open, close, high, and low prices, offering more information
than simple line charts.

## Understanding Candlestick Patterns

Candlestick patterns are formed by the arrangement of candle bodies and
shadows. They provide insights into market sentiment and potential trend
reversals.

## Price Action Candlestick Trading vs Indicators

While indicators can be useful, it\'s crucial to master price action
candlestick trading to understand market dynamics and make informed
decisions.

## Support and Resistance

Horizontal price levels and trend lines act as support and resistance
levels, indicating potential areas of price reversal or continuation.

## Trend Lines

Trend lines are used to identify overall trend direction and potential
trend reversals.

## Trend Indicators

Trend indicators, such as moving averages, help determine the overall
trend direction.

## Momentum Indicators

Momentum indicators, such as RSI and Stochastic, measure the strength of
a trend and identify overbought or oversold conditions.

## How Many Indicators Should You Use?

Keep your indicator usage minimal to avoid confusion and focus on price
action and key support and resistance levels.
